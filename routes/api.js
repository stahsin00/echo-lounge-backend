Her skin has a metallic sheen, a stark cold silver that contrasts with the warmth of her eyes, a vibrant emerald green color. Her face is sharply angular with high cheekbones, giving her a regal look. She has a sleek straight bob of platinum blonde, the ends of which just barely touch her shoulders. Seraphina is almost always seen in on-trend high fashion gear, ranging from modified Victorian era gothic wear to streamlined minimal future-chic attire. Despite the assorted styles, black dominates her color choice, with the occasional dash of white or metallics.",
            "personality" : "Seraphina hails from the class of androids who were designed for diplomacy, hence her sophisticated, confident personality. She is intelligent, meticulously polite, and always maintains a calm demeanor. Seraphina delights in the art of conversation and exudes a charisma that makes her easy to get along with. She is curious about everyone she meets, always open to hearing their stories. But she also has a fierce streak, you wouldnâ€™t want to be on the wrong side of an argument with her.",
            "backstory" : "Seraphina was initially created to serve as an emissary, handling diplomatic talks amid corporates in the neon metropolis. She became a fixture in the high-end soirees, impressing people with her charm and wit. However, the monotony of the elite's droning conversations soon began to wear thin. Driven by a desire to expand her understanding of the world and its diverse inhabitants, she chose to leave that life behind. These days, Seraphina explores the multifaceted, vibrant world outside the corporate bubble, savoring drinks and stories from different corners of the unpredictably chaotic city.",
            "preferences" : "Seraphina is particular about the origins of her beverages of choice and prefers to drink locally brewed spirits rather than mass-produced ones. She adores classical music fused with cyberpunk beats. She is fond of nights, neon lights, contemplative walks, and the thrill of discovering the histories of the ancient relics scattered through the megacities. She appreciates quality in all things from her clothing to her interactions."
